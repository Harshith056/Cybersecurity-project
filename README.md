Password Cracking Lab | Ethical Hacking & Cybersecurity

Overview

This project demonstrates password security vulnerabilities by simulating real-world attacks using industry-standard tools:

John the Ripper (CPU-based cracking),
Hashcat (GPU-accelerated cracking),
rockyou.txt (14M+ password wordlist).


We explore hashing algorithms (SHA-512, MD5), dictionary vs. brute-force attacks, and best practices for secure password storage.


Tools & Technologies


Kali Linux (Penetration Testing OS),
OpenSSL (Hashing & Encryption),
Python/Bash Scripting (Automation).


Key Features:


Password Hash Generation (SHA-512 with salt)
Dictionary Attack Simulation (rockyou.txt)
Performance Comparison (John vs. Hashcat)
 Security Recommendations (Strong passwords, MFA)

Results


Weak passwords (123456, password) cracked in seconds.
Strong passwords (X7!pT93$hG1&) resisted attacks.
GPU acceleration (Hashcat) proved 10x faster than CPU-based cracking.

Use Cases


Penetration Testing,
Cybersecurity Education,
Password Policy Evaluation.
